UI - How application will look like, how users will interact with  - Swing or JavaFX - desktop app for web based
java with a framework like springboot, frontend technology like react and angular

Database  - mongoDb to store songs and playlists - screenshots

API integration - real songs and playlists * Spotify- apple music, sound cloud - enable pulling data and playing music directly

Authentication and authorization - 

Sharing Functionality - method, app itself, social media, direct links

Backend Logic - server side code that handles API requests - interacts with databases and processes user inputs - frameworks like springboot

Deployment - AWS, Heroku, Google cloud
