Building a Java application that allows users to share their liked songs or playlists is an exciting project! You'll likely want to consider a few key components for your application:

1. **User Interface (UI)**: Decide how you want the application to look and how users will interact with it. For a desktop app, you might use Swing or JavaFX. For a web-based app, consider using Java with a framework like Spring Boot and a front-end technology like React or Angular.

2. **Database**: To store user information, liked songs, and playlists, you'll need a database. Common choices with Java are MySQL, PostgreSQL, or even NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

3. **API Integration**: If you want to include real songs and playlists, consider integrating with a music API like Spotify, Apple Music, or SoundCloud. This will allow you to pull song data and possibly even play music directly through your app.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**: You’ll need a way to handle user accounts securely. OAuth is a common standard used for this, especially if you're integrating with third-party music services.

5. **Sharing Functionality**: Decide on the method for users to share playlists—whether it's through direct links, social media integration, or within the app itself.

6. **Backend Logic**: This includes the server-side code that handles API requests, interacts with the database, and processes user inputs. Java frameworks like Spring Boot are very useful for this purpose.

7. **Deployment**: Finally, think about how you'll host and deploy your app. If it's a web app, you might use services like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud.

Here’s a high-level plan on how you could start:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Java Development Environment
- Install Java and a suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Set up a project using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.

### Step 2: Design Your Application
- Sketch out the UI and user flow.
- Design your database schema.
- Decide on the technologies for the frontend and backend.

### Step 3: Develop the Backend
- Implement your database using JDBC or an ORM like Hibernate.
- Create RESTful services using Spring Boot to handle CRUD operations for users, songs, and playlists.

### Step 4: Integrate Music API
- Choose a music API and get the necessary API keys.
- Implement API calls to fetch song data and handle authentication.

### Step 5: Develop the Frontend
- Build the user interface using your chosen technology.
- Connect the frontend to the backend using AJAX or a state management library.

### Step 6: Add Authentication
- Implement user authentication using OAuth or another secure method.
- Ensure that users can only access their data.

### Step 7: Implement Sharing Features
- Add functionality to share playlists and liked songs.
- Consider privacy settings and how links can be accessed.

### Step 8: Test Your Application
- Conduct thorough testing, both automated and manual, to catch bugs.

### Step 9: Deploy Your Application
- Deploy your application to a web server or cloud service.
- Ensure it's scalable to handle multiple users.

### Step 10: Maintain and Update
- Regularly update the application with new features and maintain it by fixing any issues that arise.
