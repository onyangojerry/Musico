UI - How application will look like, how users will interact with  - Swing or JavaFX - desktop app for web based
java with a framework like springboot, frontend technology like react and angular

Database  - mongoDb to store songs and playlists - screenshots

API integration - real songs and playlists * Spotify- apple music, sound cloud - enable pulling data and playing music directly

Authentication and authorization - 

Sharing Functionality - method, app itself, social media, direct links

Backend Logic - server side code that handles API requests - interacts with databases and processes user inputs - frameworks like springboot

Deployment - AWS, Heroku, Google cloud

Creating a user flow diagram is a great way to visualize the steps a user takes when interacting with your application. This helps in planning the user experience and identifying any potential roadblocks. Here's a basic guide to sketching a user flow for your app where users can share liked songs or playlists:

### Step 1: Define Your Goals
Before starting, clarify what you want users to achieve in your app. In your case, it could be:
- Discover new music.
- Create and manage playlists.
- Share playlists with others.
- Interact with other users' playlists.

### Step 2: Identify Key User Actions
Think about the actions needed to achieve these goals:
- **Sign Up/Login**: Users need to access their personalized environment.
- **Browse Music**: Users explore available songs or playlists.
- **Create Playlist**: Users select songs and create a new playlist.
- **Edit Playlist**: Users modify existing playlists.
- **Share Playlist**: Users share playlists via a link or on social media.
- **View Others' Playlists**: Users view playlists shared by others.
- **Interact with Playlists**: Users like, comment on, or follow other playlists.

### Step 3: Map Out the User Flow
Here's how you might sketch the user flow, starting from the user entering the app to completing a primary task like sharing a playlist:

1. **Home Page**
   - Login/Sign Up
   - After login, navigate to the main dashboard.

2. **Dashboard**
   - View own playlists.
   - Access shared playlists.
   - Search bar to discover new music or playlists.

3. **Playlist Interaction**
   - **Create a Playlist**:
     - Click "Create Playlist".
     - Search and select songs.
     - Name the playlist and save.
   - **Edit a Playlist**:
     - Select an existing playlist.
     - Add/remove songs, rename the playlist.
   - **Share a Playlist**:
     - Choose a playlist to share.
     - Click "Share".
     - Select sharing method (link, social media).
     - Confirm and send.

4. **Viewing Others' Playlists**
   - Click on a shared link or navigate via dashboard.
   - Interact with the playlist (like, comment, follow).

5. **User Profile and Settings**
   - Manage account settings.
   - View activity and interactions.

### Step 4: Create a Visual Diagram
Use a tool like Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio, or even simple drawing tools like draw.io to create a visual representation of this flow. This visual should map out each step and decision point in the process from the user's perspective.

### Step 5: Iterate Based on Feedback
Once you have your initial user flow diagram, review it with potential users or stakeholders. Get feedback and make adjustments as necessary. This might include adding additional steps, simplifying the process, or improving navigation.
